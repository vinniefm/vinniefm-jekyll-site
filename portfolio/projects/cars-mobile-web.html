  intro:
    Cars.com was early to the mobile web with an initial release in 2006 but by 2010, due to contractual issues and an aging 3rd party mobile platform, the company found itself with an archaic site that was costly to maintain and upgrade, and exhibited poor adoption.

  problem: 
    The Cars.com story is one of innovation and disruption going back to its founding in 1998. By 2010 the company's mobile presence hadn't advanced much since their initial mobile foray in 2006. 
    
    <h4>Photos and video</h4>
    <p>Car shoppers consistently state that photos and videos are critical to the online shopping experience. It's not uncommon to see inventory listings having 30, 40, or even 50 photos, yet the mobile web experience often rendered images in low resolution and gallery navigation interactions were sub-optimal.</p>
    
    <h4>Roundtrip experience, mobile and desktop</h4>
    <p>Lacking a user account sub-system meant that work completed in one environment was not reflected in the other.</p>

    <h4>Brand confusion</h4>
    <p>The mobile web and desktop experiences differed drastically resulting in user confusion about what brand they were interacting with and frustration due to lack of features (primarily filtering of search) vs. the desktop experience.</p>

  process: 
    One of the Cars.com innovations was to start investing in UX research, distinct interaction design tasks, and other standard components of "UX" in the early 2000's. That said, this project commenced in 2010 while the company continued to rely on their trusted but inefficient waterfall process. 

  solution: 
    <p>As illustrated in the above slideshow, the solution involved updating the color palette and navigation system to better reflect the then current Cars.com brand experience and synchronize the IA across all platforms. Photos were also updated to render across the full width/height of the viewport in addition to supporting expected swipe interactions in touch environments.</p>

    <p>It's been a while and the site has gone through many incremental updates in addition to a complete brand overhaul 2014, but I'm happy to say that this project set a new course for the entire team in terms of our design thinking about mobile</p>
