  problem: 
    "When analyzing various business metrics of the beauty and wellness industry, it quickly becomes obvious that it is broken. This is particularly apparent when looking at the consumer/service provider relationship. Conservative estimates suggest annual revenue of $60+ billion on haircuts and massage alone. Yet, two problems exist...

    <h4>Market share</h4>

    Shockingly, the top 50 players control a mere 15% of the annual revenue.

    <h4>Service provider income</h4>

    While service providers own the loyalty in the consumer relationship, they typically leave 60% or more of their transaction revenue to the salon or spa. This results in full time employment achieving approximately a $23,000/year income. That's not far from the poverty line."
