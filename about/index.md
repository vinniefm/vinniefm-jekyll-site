My name is Vince Mease. I'm a Product Management and UX professional working in Chicago, IL. My efforts are currently focused on all aspects of designing and managing the development of LISA App. We're a startup, just launched Jan 2016, developing an open platform mobile application connecting providers of beauty and wellness services with the consumers wanting those services (think hair stylists, estheticians, and massage therapists). 

I live in Louisville, KY with my beautiful wife, 2 daughters, and a growing collection of fine bourbons.
